# deeporange14_control Package
# Deep Orange DBW Controls Interface Package for Autonomous Driving

### Functionality:

- DeepOrangeDbwCan.cpp: Enable passing the ROS topics to the Raptor DBW controller via SocketCAN, which executes the commands for the platform to move. Additionally monitors rtk fix, logging status
- VelocityController.cpp: Use the vehicle dynamics model to convert vehicle velocity to left and right track velocity/torques.
- StateMachine.cpp: A ROS state machine in sync with the Raptor controller state machine.
- RosHealthMonitor.cpp: A node that Monitor health of raptor hanshake, brake acknowledgement from raptor , autonomy stack fault and dbw ros mode
- DataLoggerNode.cpp: logging CAN and ROS data while monitoring logging status active or Fail
- Node.cpp - Instantiates the three objects in a single node (as of now).

### How to Use:
- To add/update CAN msg IDs- update these in the dbc in the `dbc` folder as well as `dispatch_can_msgs.h` include file
- Vehicle and subsystem states are enumerated in `DeeporangeStateEnums.h`
